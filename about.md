MISSION STATEMENT
Jesus Calls International’s mission and purpose is to exalt the Lord Jesus Christ and heal the brokenhearted that their sorrows may be turned to joy.

VISION STATEMENT
We accomplish our mission through the operation of the Jesus Calls Prayer Towers around the world where intercessory prayer is offered 24 hours a day. Jesus Calls also conducts public prayer festivals and broadcasts its message through the media in order to see people forever changed through the love and compassion of Jesus Christ. It is the dream of the Dhinakarans that “not one soul would be lost.”

BIBLICAL FOUNDATION
“Therefore go make disciples of all nations, baptising them in the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit, and teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you. And surely I am with you, always, to the end of the age” (Matthew 28:19-20 NIV).
